          The <i>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</i> was by a significant margin the strongest system released by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It was so much more powerful than the others, in fact, that it could run two 4k screens at once with its dual video output ports. Unlike its predecessors, it also came in more than one version, each having a different amount of RAM and thus running at different speed. Unfortunately, it was at this point in the Pi’s career that the $35 dollar price tag it had made a name off of was not going to cut it anymore. The base version was still 35 dollars, but the superior version costed $55. This system had nearly four times the RAM of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, its preceding system, as well as boasting a 25% increase in processing speed, two video ports, and a newer version of Bluetooth. Just like the Pi 3, however, the <i>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</i> had wireless internet functionality. Additionally, the Pi 4 follows in the footsteps of the Pi’s which came before it, being designed to run Linux and only Linux, as opposed to the more broadly popular Windows 10. Alongside all of these wonderful improvements, the ethernet port was now capable of handling gigabit speeds, meaning that it was over 3 times faster than the previous Model B. Unfortunately, however, all of these improvements on such a tiny board led to common reports of overheating issues caused by the boards being worked much harder than their predecessors.
